# Introduction #

Fiblib is an efficient, imperative Fibonacci heap library, based on the pseudocode of Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein. It aims to be practical and elegant.

Please, enter an issue here if you find any problems with the code!  I'd like to know if this heap is being used, or if it's useless.

Testing a priority queue can be a challenge.  The TestIdeas page contains some ideas.

## Dependencies ##
Fiblib currently depends on [OUnit](http://www.xs4all.nl/~mmzeeman/ocaml/), but only if you want to build and run the unit tests.
